# Poker
Very simplistic 5-card draw poker program for an object-oriented software design final group project.

The Poker/src directory contains the clean, compiled program whereas the folders in the main directory contain the compiled files as well as the source code.

Once ran, a new window will pop up at the home screen that prompts the user to start a new game or continue the previous game.
Starting a new game will bring the user to a new screen that allows customization of number of opponents, starting money, and ante amount.
Past that, the user is able to play the game with a very simple gameplay loop.
Upon exiting the game, the game is automatically saved with a new file being created on the computer.

Credits-
The game was developed as part of the model-views-controller methodology.
The views were done by group member 2.
The model was mostly programmed by me, this includes the very basic opponent a.i., but there were also some features programmed by the teacher. These include Card and Deck.
The controller was worked on by me, group member 2, and group member 3.
